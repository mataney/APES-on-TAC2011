There is no material evidence against Egyptian Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, who goes on trial on Thursday accused of being one of the masterminds behind the deadly train bombings in Madrid on March 11, 2004, his lawyer told AFP.
The trial opens Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the Madrid train bomb attacks in March 2004, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike Spain has ever known.
